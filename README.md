This is a development stage app designed to display New York Times top story headlines and article descriptions in a concise and quick to consume manner.
There are no pictures to accompany articles. Users will be able to click articles to view them in their entirety on the New York Times site.
At this time there will not be search functionality in this app. Users will only be able to view the top ten stories for each of 8 preselected subjects.
Stories will reload with the most recent articles on the NYT site each time the user refreshes the page. Articles will not be archived.

Rather than keep people informed, this app is designed to allow users to scan top headlines quickl, read any they so choose and then get on with their lives.
